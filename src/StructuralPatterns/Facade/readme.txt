Facade pattern is to provide a simply, easy-to-use API extracted from a large amount of code, like a library.
When we are faced with a large system, we probably just need to use a very small part of it, 
or when we are faced with a collection of poor designed API, we want a well-designed unifined API.

We can use the Facade Pattern to create a new simple interface (API) for us to use.
